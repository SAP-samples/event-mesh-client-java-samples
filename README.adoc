== Note
The SAP Cloud Platform Enterprise Messaging service has been renamed to SAP Event Mesh - find more information in this link:https://blogs.sap.com/2021/02/22/please-welcome-sap-event-mesh-new-name-for-sap-cloud-platform-enterprise-messaging/[blog article].

== Description
SAP Event Mesh provides a cloud-based messaging framework for the development of decoupled and resilient services and integration flows (using SAP Cloud Integration) to support asynchronous communication principles.
Direct integration with SAP S/4HANA Business Event Handling allows efficient development of innovative and scaling extensions.

This sample demonstrates Event Mesh with Java, using combinations of vanilla Java, Spring, and JMS. Details on each sample application and the covered scenario are described in the table _List of sample projects_ below.

For more details of **SAP Event Mesh** take a look at the link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/df532e8735eb4322b00bfc7e42f84e8d.html[SAP Event Mesh on SAP Help portal].

|Application for Event Mesh based on Spring Web running on SAP Business Technology Platform (@ CloudFoundry (with Event Mesh Service)).
|This sample demonstrates how messages can be send and received from a SAP BTP deployed application. Therefore the messaging sample provides a _Spring Boot_ based application which provides REST endpoints for _send_ and _receive_ messages via a queue (or queues) of choice. The REST endpoints are provided via the `MessagingServiceRestController`.

|Application for Event Mesh based on Spring Web running on SAP Business Technology Platform (@ CloudFoundry (with Event Mesh Service)).
|This sample demonstrates how messages can be send and received from a topic from a SAP BTP deployed application. Therefore the messaging sample provides a _Spring Boot_ based application which provides REST endpoints for _send_ and _receive_ messages via a topic of choice. It also offers a REST endpoint to receive a message from a queue. The REST endpoints are provided via the `MessagingServiceRestController`.

== Download and Installation
To download and install the samples just clone this repository via `git clone`

For details on how to configure and run the samples please take a look into the README in the corresponding samples directory.

== Usage of the client

This section describes the usage of the client without any sample application. It is described which dependencies are needed and how a `MessagingServiceJmsConnectionFactory` is received in a short way.

=== Dependencies

Three different dependencies are needed:

. the emjapi spring service connector which provides the `MessagingService`
. the emjapi core which creates the connection factory
. the emjapi JMS extension which provides the `MessagingServiceJmsConnectionFactory`

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.sap.cloud.servicesdk.xbem</groupId>
	<artifactId>emjapi-connector-sap-cp</artifactId>
	<version>${version.xbem.client}</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.sap.cloud.servicesdk.xbem</groupId>
	<artifactId>emjapi-core</artifactId>
	<version>${version.xbem.client}</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.sap.cloud.servicesdk.xbem</groupId>
	<artifactId>emjapi-extension-sap-cp-jms</artifactId>
	<version>${version.xbem.client}</version>
</dependency>
```

=== Code snippets

Get the `MessagingService` via the spring `Cloud` object

```java
ServiceConnectorConfig config = null; // currently there are no configurations for the MessagingServiceFactory supported
Cloud cloud = new CloudFactory().getCloud();
// get a messaging service factory via the service connector
MessagingService messagingService = cloud.getSingletonServiceConnector(MessagingService.class, config);
```

Create a the `MessagingServiceFactory` object with the help of the `MessagingServiceFactoryCreator` and get a `MessagingServiceJmsConnectionFactory`. 
The Connection Factory can be configured with the `MessagingServiceJmsSettings`. In case the reconnection feature is not needed and an individual 
connection mechanism (e.G. through a connection cache) is used the settings can be skipped. The connection factory can be built with 
`messagingServiceFactory.createConnectionFactory(MessagingServiceJmsConnectionFactory.class,settings)`.

```java
MessagingServiceJmsSettings settings = new MessagingServiceJmsSettings(); // settings are preset with default values (see JavaDoc)
settings.setMaxReconnectAttempts(5); // use -1 for unlimited attempts
settings.setInitialReconnectDelay(3000);
settings.setReconnectDelay(3000);
MessagingServiceFactory messagingServiceFactory = MessagingServiceFactoryCreator.createFactory(messagingService);
MessagingServiceJmsConnectionFactory connectionFactory = messagingServiceFactory.createConnectionFactory(MessagingServiceJmsConnectionFactory.class, settings)
```

Further the `MessagingServiceJmsConnectionFactory` is used to create a connection and a session.

```java
Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection();
Session session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE));
```

== Messaging Management API
The messaging management api (MM API) provides functionality for creating, deleting and updating queues and queue subscriptions.
Further more it provides APIs to get information on queues and queue subscriptions.
The MM API documentation can be found link:https://help.sap.com/doc/75c9efd00fc14183abc4c613490c53f4/Cloud/en-US/rest-management-messaging.html[here]. 
The MM APIs have to be enabled in the service descriptor. A description for enabling the MM API can be found link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/d0483a9e38434f23a4579d6fcc72654b.html[here].

== Creation of queues with the UI
Queues can be created through the SAP Business Technology Platform Cockpit UI.
More information regarding the creation of queues through the UI can be found link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/57af1bd4e8f54b0a9b36414a5ec6b800.html[here]

== Service Descriptor
Examples for the different service descriptors can be found link:https://help.sap.com/viewer/bf82e6b26456494cbdd197057c09979f/Cloud/en-US/d0483a9e38434f23a4579d6fcc72654b.html[here] on the help site
